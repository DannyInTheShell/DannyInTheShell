  <h2>Cybersecurity &amp; IT Project Portfolio</h2>
</div>


Welcome to my project portfolio. Here you'll find hands-on security projects that demonstrate skills built through learning, experimentation, and real problem solving. I update projects regularly as I expand my expertise.

## About Me

I bring two decades of diverse work experience, a relentless curiosity, and a passion for creative problem solving. I thrive on tough challenges, dive in, learn fast, and ship repeatable solutions. Cybersecurity is where I feel most at home: protect, learn, adapt, and help people stay safe.

> No theatrics. Just craft. Kamado Joe habits, applied to security.

### Experience highlights

- 👥 Leading and training teams across technical and operational domains  
- 🖥️ Troubleshooting and resolving complex IT issues (Layer 8...)  
- ⚙️ Automating workflows, scripting solutions, and securing systems  
- 🔐 Managing vulnerabilities with Tenable and hardening cloud infrastructure in Azure ☁️  
- 🛡️ Physical security for events and individuals, keeping people and assets safe

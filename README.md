# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-a-c-136020286/">Danny A Cologero</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

Welcome to my project portfolio. Here you'll find hands-on security projects that demonstrate skills built through learning, experimentation, and real problem solving. I update projects regularly as I expand my expertise.

## About Me

I bring two decades of diverse work experience, a relentless curiosity, and a passion for creative problem solving. I thrive on tough challenges, dive in, learn fast, and ship repeatable solutions. Cybersecurity is where I feel most at home: protect, learn, adapt, and help people stay safe.

*A little flavor:* Viking Jedi energy 🛡️⚔️ with a cape of technical expertise and a Kamado Joe for fuel and inspiration.

### Experience highlights

- 👥 Leading and training teams across technical and operational domains  
- 🖥️ Troubleshooting and resolving complex IT issues (Layer 8...)  
- ⚙️ Automating workflows, scripting solutions, and securing systems  
- 🔐 Managing vulnerabilities with Tenable and hardening cloud infrastructure in Azure ☁️  
- 🛡️ Physical security for events and individuals, keeping people and assets safe

# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-a-c-136020286/">Danny A Cologero</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

Welcome to my project portfolio. Here you’ll find hands-on security projects demonstrating skills I’ve built through learning, experimentation, and tackling complex challenges. Projects are updated regularly as I expand my expertise.

## About Me

I bring over 20 years of professional experience, a relentless curiosity, and a passion for solving problems creatively. I thrive on challenges, diving in wide-eyed, mastering the unknown, and emerging like a Viking Jedi Master 🛡️⚔️ with a cape of technical expertise and Kamado Joe for fuel and inspiration.

### My experience spans:

- 👥 Leading and training teams across technical and operational domains
- 🖥️ Troubleshooting and resolving complex IT issues (Layer 8…)
- ⚙️ Automating workflows, scripting solutions, and securing systems
- 🔐 Managing vulnerabilities with Tenable and hardening cloud infrastructure in Azure ☁️
- 🛡️ Physical security work for events and individuals, keeping people and things safe, sometimes unnoticed but always effective

Cybersecurity is where I feel most at home. I strive to combine technical skills, strategic thinking, and a commitment to protecting people and systems. I approach cybersecurity with the same mindset I’ve had since childhood: protect, learn, adapt, and help people stay safe, whether they realize it or not.

# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-a-c-136020286/">Danny A Cologero</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üîê

Welcome to my project portfolio. Here you‚Äôll find hands-on security projects demonstrating skills I‚Äôve built through learning, experimentation, and tackling complex challenges. Projects are updated regularly as I expand my expertise.

## About Me

I bring over 20 years of professional experience, a relentless curiosity, and a passion for solving problems creatively. I thrive on challenges, diving in wide-eyed, mastering the unknown, and emerging like a Viking Jedi with a cape of technical expertise (Kamado Joe included for fuel and inspiration).

My experience spans:
- Leading and training teams across technical and operational domains.
- Troubleshooting and resolving complex IT issues. (Layer 8...)
- Automating workflows, scripting solutions, and securing systems.
- Managing vulnerabilities with Tenable and hardening cloud infrastructure in Azure.
- Physical security work for events and individuals. Keeping people and things safe, sometimes unnoticed but always effective.

Cybersecurity is where I feel most at home. I strive to combine technical skills, strategic thinking, and a commitment to protecting people and systems. I approach cybersecurity with the same mindset I‚Äôve had since childhood: protect, learn, adapt, and help people stay safe, whether they realize it or not.

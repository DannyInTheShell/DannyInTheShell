Personal &amp; Educational Security Projects

## Welcome to My Cybersecurity Project Portfolio  

Thank you for visiting my repository! I plan to update this often and with as many security projects as possible. The current intent of this collection of projects is to showcases the practical cybersecurity skills I’ve developed and am currently developing through hands-on experience and dedicated learning.

I have more than two decades of work experience, a serious commitment (possibly an addiction) to learning new things, a decent sence of humor, and a Kamado Joe which may just be my greatest investment. I have gained solid experience throughout my career in managing/training multiple teams, troubleshooting issues, and solving problems creatively. I have learned a ton from each person I've trained or have been trained by, and I look for the value in each new experience and relationship. Every day, I strive to sharpen my skills and adapt to whatever is thrown my way. I love difficult challanges, ones that I go into not knowing anything completely wide eyed, and then come out the otherside some kind of Viking Jedi master of sorts, with a cape of course. My goal is to humbly pave a way through the cybersecurity world and find a challanging but rewarding path. I've always been very security conscious since I was a kid. I do quite a bit of physical security work in my spare time, some for large events some for individual people. I really enjoy the personal feeling of helping people to be as safe as possible whether they realize it or not. Look at me sounding all 007ish like I operate in the shadows or something; I do have active shooter training though, so almost 007. I know its not easy, and I dont need it to be, but cybersecurity just feels right at this point in my life.

## Why This Portfolio?  
The goal is to provide a glimpse into my practical skills and illustrate why I’d be a valuable addition to any security team. From conducting security audits to scripting automation and securing networks, each project is designed to highlight my technical abilities and dedication to staying ahead in this dynamic field.  

## Explore & Connect  
Feel free to take a look around! I encourage you to explore the projects and see what I’ve been working on. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, I’d love to connect with you. 

I would also greatly appreciate any feedback you wish to offer.
